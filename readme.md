# Uber-clone (Project)

This README describes the "Uber-Video" demo project — purpose, setup, usage, structure, features, implementation notes, and backend file explanations.

## 1. Overview
Uber-Video is a demo/prototype showcasing video features: recording, playback, uploading, basic streaming, and management. It focuses on client UI workflows and core functionality rather than a production backend.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+ recommended or the version in package.json)
- npm or yarn
- Internet connection if using CDNs or third-party APIs
- (Optional) Android/iOS emulator or a modern browser

## 3. Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone <project-repo-url>
2. Change to project directory:
   - cd "c:\Users\rachit gupta\Documents\vs code file\Uber Clone\uber-video"
3. Install dependencies:
   - npm install
   - or
   - yarn install

## 4. Run / Development
- Start development server:
  - npm start
  - or
  - yarn start
- Build & serve (if applicable):
  - npm run build
  - npm run serve

Refer to package.json scripts for exact commands.

## 5. Features
- Video recording: camera and microphone capture, preview, local save or upload.
- Video playback: play local/remote videos with controls (play, pause, seek).
- Uploading: multipart or resumable uploads with progress feedback.
- Streaming: basic streaming via HLS/DASH (if configured) or direct file delivery.
- Video management: list, preview, delete, and download videos.
- UX: responsive player, keyboard/touch-friendly controls, error messages.
- Extensibility: hooks to integrate authentication, real backends, or CDN storage.

## 6. Typical Folder Structure
- src/ — application source code
  - components/ — reusable UI components
  - pages/ or screens/ — views (Recording, Gallery, Player)
  - services/ or api/ — HTTP clients and API wrappers
  - utils/ — helper functions
  - assets/ — images and demo media
- public/ — static files and index.html
- package.json — dependencies and scripts

Adjust to match your repository layout.

## 7. Configuration (Environment)
- Use a .env file for environment-specific settings and secrets (gitignored).
  - Example: REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
- Provide a .env.example documenting required variables.

## 8. Testing
- Run tests:
  - npm test
  - or
  - yarn test
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests; Cypress or Playwright for E2E.

## 9. Deployment
- Build for production:
  - npm run build
- Deploy build output to static hosts (Netlify, Vercel, S3 + CloudFront) or to your server.

## 10. Troubleshooting
- Dependency errors: remove node_modules and reinstall.
- Port conflicts: change dev server port or stop the conflicting process.
- Media permission issues: ensure browser/emulator has camera/microphone access.
- Unsupported formats: convert videos to common codecs (H.264 + AAC).

## 11. Contributing
- Create feature branches: feature/your-change
- Open a Pull Request with summary and testing steps
- Follow code style and linting rules

## 12. License & Contact
- Add a LICENSE file (MIT, Apache, etc.) and reference it here.
- Provide maintainer contact or GitHub profile for questions and contributions.

## Implementation Guide — how to implement main features (concise)

Recording (Client)
- Use navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true }).
- Use MediaRecorder to collect chunks, then new Blob(chunks, { type: 'video/webm' }).
- Preview via URL.createObjectURL(blob) before upload/save.

Playback (Client)
- Use HTML <video> with controls; use hls.js/dash.js for HLS/DASH support.
- Offer resolution/quality selector when multiple renditions exist.

Uploading & Resumable Uploads
- Simple upload: POST multipart/form-data to /api/videos.
- Resumable: use tus-js-client or implement chunk endpoints with progress and retry.

Server-side Processing & Streaming
- Transcode using ffmpeg to multiple bitrates and generate HLS/DASH manifests.
- Store segments/manifests in object storage (S3) and serve via CDN or use managed services (Mux).

Video Metadata & Management
- Store metadata in DB: id, filename, duration, resolutions, thumbnailUrl, createdAt, ownerId.
- Generate thumbnails with ffmpeg or on-demand serverside logic.
- Expose endpoints: GET /api/videos, GET /api/videos/:id, DELETE /api/videos/:id.

Security & Auth
- Protect upload and management endpoints with JWT or session auth.
- Validate file types and enforce size limits server-side.
- Use signed upload URLs for direct-to-storage flows.

Testing & CI
- Unit tests for components and services; E2E for record→upload→playback.
- CI pipelines to run lint, tests, and build (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI).

Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard-accessible controls, provide captions (WebVTT), and maintain contrast.

Observability
- Log upload/transcode failures and expose metrics for monitoring.
- Integrate error tracking (Sentry) for client/server.

Quick flow mapping:
Frontend (record) → API upload endpoint → controller validates → service stores file (S3/local) → enqueue worker → worker transcodes/thumbnails → DB updated → frontend fetches metadata → playback via CDN/streaming.

If you want, I can add example snippets (multer upload route, basic ffmpeg worker), a .env.example, or sample package.json scripts. Tell me which additions you prefer.
- Support multiple resolutions and provide a quality selector.

### Uploading & Resumable Uploads
- Simple upload: POST multipart/form-data to /api/videos (file + metadata).
- Resumable/chunked uploads: use tus protocol (tus-js-client) or implement chunk endpoints (/api/uploads/chunk).
- Provide upload progress UI and retry logic on failure.

Server endpoint examples:
- POST /api/videos — accept full file upload
- POST /api/uploads/init — initialize chunked upload
- PUT /api/uploads/:id/chunk — upload chunk
- POST /api/videos/:id/complete — finalize upload

### Streaming & Transcoding (Server)
- Use ffmpeg to transcode uploads into multiple bitrates and HLS/DASH manifests.
- Store generated segments on object storage (S3) and serve via CDN.
- Alternatively, use cloud services (Mux, Cloudinary, AWS Elastic Transcoder) for managed pipelines.

### Video Management & Metadata
- Save metadata in a DB: id, filename, duration, resolutions, thumbnailUrl, createdAt, ownerId.
- Generate thumbnails server-side via ffmpeg (-ss to capture a frame) or client-side for quick previews.
- Provide endpoints: GET /api/videos, GET /api/videos/:id, DELETE /api/videos/:id.

### UI / UX Considerations
- Provide clear state flows: recording → preview → save/upload → processing → ready.
- Show processing status and ETA after upload (queued, transcoding, ready).
- Keyboard shortcuts for playback and accessible labels for controls.
- Mobile-first responsive layout and touch targets.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT or session-based auth.
- Ensure upload and management endpoints require auth and check ownership/permissions.

### Security & Validation
- Validate file types and size limits on server.
- Scan uploads for malware (where applicable).
- Enforce CORS and rate limits; use signed upload URLs for direct-to-storage uploads.

### Performance & Cost
- Transcode to multiple resolutions to reduce bandwidth for clients.
- Use CDN + caching for delivery.
- Support on-the-fly thumbnail generation or cache thumbnails to reduce repeated ffmpeg runs.

### Testing & CI
- Unit-test React/Angular/Vue components (Jest + React Testing Library).
- E2E tests for flows (Cypress or Playwright): record → upload → playback.
- Add CI pipeline to run lint, tests, and build (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI).

### Accessibility
- Ensure video player controls are keyboard accessible and labeled (aria-label).
- Support captions/subtitles (WebVTT) and provide toggle for captions.
- Maintain contrast and focus outlines.

### Observability & Monitoring
- Log upload/transcode failures with context (video id, user).
- Expose basic metrics: uploads/day, average processing time, failed uploads.
- Integrate error tracking (Sentry) for client and server errors.

### Deployment & Ops
- For small projects: Node/Express + S3 + CloudFront.
- For scalable systems: separate ingestion service, transcoder workers (Docker + Kubernetes) and a CDN-fronted object store.
- Automate backups for metadata DB and storage lifecycle rules for old media.

### Next steps / TODOs (project-specific)
- Decide storage strategy (local vs S3).
- Choose transcoding approach (ffmpeg vs managed service).
- Implement authentication and basic upload endpoint.
- Build UI flows for recording → preview → upload → processing → playback.

Quick flow mapping:
Frontend (record) → API upload endpoint → controller validates → service stores file (S3/local) → enqueue worker → worker transcodes/thumbnails → DB updated → frontend fetches metadata → playback via CDN/streaming.

If you want, I can add example snippets (multer upload route, basic ffmpeg worker), a .env.example, or sample package.json scripts. Tell me which additions you prefer.
- Support multiple resolutions and provide a quality selector.

### Uploading & Resumable Uploads
- Simple upload: POST multipart/form-data to /api/videos (file + metadata).
- Resumable/chunked uploads: use tus protocol (tus-js-client) or implement chunk endpoints (/api/uploads/chunk).
- Provide upload progress UI and retry logic on failure.

Server endpoint examples:
- POST /api/videos — accept full file upload
- POST /api/uploads/init — initialize chunked upload
- PUT /api/uploads/:id/chunk — upload chunk
- POST /api/videos/:id/complete — finalize upload

### Streaming & Transcoding (Server)
- Use ffmpeg to transcode uploads into multiple bitrates and HLS/DASH manifests.
- Store generated segments on object storage (S3) and serve via CDN.
- Alternatively, use cloud services (Mux, Cloudinary, AWS Elastic Transcoder) for managed pipelines.

### Video Management & Metadata
- Save metadata in a DB: id, filename, duration, resolutions, thumbnailUrl, createdAt, ownerId.
- Generate thumbnails server-side via ffmpeg (-ss to capture a frame) or client-side for quick previews.
- Provide endpoints: GET /api/videos, GET /api/videos/:id, DELETE /api/videos/:id.

### UI / UX Considerations
- Provide clear state flows: recording → preview → save/upload → processing → ready.
- Show processing status and ETA after upload (queued, transcoding, ready).
- Keyboard shortcuts for playback and accessible labels for controls.
- Mobile-first responsive layout and touch targets.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT or session-based auth.
- Ensure upload and management endpoints require auth and check ownership/permissions.

### Security & Validation
- Validate file types and size limits on server.
- Scan uploads for malware (where applicable).
- Enforce CORS and rate limits; use signed upload URLs for direct-to-storage uploads.

### Performance & Cost
- Transcode to multiple resolutions to reduce bandwidth for clients.
- Use CDN + caching for delivery.
- Support on-the-fly thumbnail generation or cache thumbnails to reduce repeated ffmpeg runs.

### Testing & CI
- Unit-test React/Angular/Vue components (Jest + React Testing Library).
- E2E tests for flows (Cypress or Playwright): record → upload → playback.
- Add CI pipeline to run lint, tests, and build (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI).

### Accessibility
- Ensure video player controls are keyboard accessible and labeled (aria-label).
- Support captions/subtitles (WebVTT) and provide toggle for captions.
- Maintain contrast and focus outlines.

### Observability & Monitoring
- Log upload/transcode failures with context (video id, user).
- Expose basic metrics: uploads/day, average processing time, failed uploads.
- Integrate error tracking (Sentry) for client and server errors.

### Deployment & Ops
- For small projects: Node/Express + S3 + CloudFront.
- For scalable systems: separate ingestion service, transcoder workers (Docker + Kubernetes) and a CDN-fronted object store.
- Automate backups for metadata DB and storage lifecycle rules for old media.

### Next steps / TODOs (project-specific)
- Decide storage strategy (local vs S3).
- Choose transcoding approach (ffmpeg vs managed service).
- Implement authentication and basic upload endpoint.
- Build UI flows for recording → preview → upload → processing → playback.

Quick flow mapping:
Frontend (record) → API upload endpoint → controller validates → service stores file (S3/local) → enqueue worker → worker transcodes/thumbnails → DB updated → frontend fetches metadata → playback via CDN/streaming.

If you want, I can add example snippets (multer upload route, basic ffmpeg worker), a .env.example, or sample package.json scripts. Tell me which additions you prefer.
- Support multiple resolutions and provide a quality selector.

### Uploading & Resumable Uploads
- Simple upload: POST multipart/form-data to /api/videos (file + metadata).
- Resumable/chunked uploads: use tus protocol (tus-js-client) or implement chunk endpoints (/api/uploads/chunk).
- Provide upload progress UI and retry logic on failure.

Server endpoint examples:
- POST /api/videos — accept full file upload
- POST /api/uploads/init — initialize chunked upload
- PUT /api/uploads/:id/chunk — upload chunk
- POST /api/videos/:id/complete — finalize upload

### Streaming & Transcoding (Server)
- Use ffmpeg to transcode uploads into multiple bitrates and HLS/DASH manifests.
- Store generated segments on object storage (S3) and serve via CDN.
- Alternatively, use cloud services (Mux, Cloudinary, AWS Elastic Transcoder) for managed pipelines.

### Video Management & Metadata
- Save metadata in a DB: id, filename, duration, resolutions, thumbnailUrl, createdAt, ownerId.
- Generate thumbnails server-side via ffmpeg (-ss to capture a frame) or client-side for quick previews.
- Provide endpoints: GET /api/videos, GET /api/videos/:id, DELETE /api/videos/:id.

### UI / UX Considerations
- Provide clear state flows: recording → preview → save/upload → processing → ready.
- Show processing status and ETA after upload (queued, transcoding, ready).
- Keyboard shortcuts for playback and accessible labels for controls.
- Mobile-first responsive layout and touch targets.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT or session-based auth.
- Ensure upload and management endpoints require auth and check ownership/permissions.

### Security & Validation
- Validate file types and size limits on server.
- Scan uploads for malware (where applicable).
- Enforce CORS and rate limits; use signed upload URLs for direct-to-storage uploads.

### Performance & Cost
- Transcode to multiple resolutions to reduce bandwidth for clients.
- Use CDN + caching for delivery.
- Support on-the-fly thumbnail generation or cache thumbnails to reduce repeated ffmpeg runs.

### Testing & CI
- Unit-test React/Angular/Vue components (Jest + React Testing Library).
- E2E tests for flows (Cypress or Playwright): record → upload → playback.
- Add CI pipeline to run lint, tests, and build (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI).

### Accessibility
- Ensure video player controls are keyboard accessible and labeled (aria-label).
- Support captions/subtitles (WebVTT) and provide toggle for captions.
- Maintain contrast and focus outlines.

### Observability & Monitoring
- Log upload/transcode failures with context (video id, user).
- Expose basic metrics: uploads/day, average processing time, failed uploads.
- Integrate error tracking (Sentry) for client and server errors.

### Deployment & Ops
- For small projects: Node/Express + S3 + CloudFront.
- For scalable systems: separate ingestion service, transcoder workers (Docker + Kubernetes) and a CDN-fronted object store.
- Automate backups for metadata DB and storage lifecycle rules for old media.

### Next steps / TODOs (project-specific)
- Decide storage strategy (local vs S3).
- Choose transcoding approach (ffmpeg vs managed service).
- Implement authentication and basic upload endpoint.
- Build UI flows for recording → preview → upload → processing → playback.
